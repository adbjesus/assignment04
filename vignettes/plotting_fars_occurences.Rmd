This vignette shows how to plot a map for FARS occurrences using the
`fars_map_state` function.

The first thing we need to do is make sure that our current working
directory has FARS data files named `accident_{year}.csv.bz2`, where
`{year}` is a 4 digit number, e.g. `2013`.

```{r}
list.files(pattern = "accident_*.csv.bz2", recursive = FALSE)
```

Then, we simply need to call the `fars_map_state` function with the
state and year we are interested in plotting.

```{r}
fars_map_state(1, 2013)
```

And there we have it.
