This vignette shows how to plot a map for FARS occurrences using the
`fars_map_state` function.

The first thing we need to do is to change the working directory to
where the FARS data files are.

```{r}
setwd(system.file("inst", package = "assignment04"))
```

Then, we simply need to call the `fars_map_state` function with the
state and year we are interested in plotting.

```{r}
fars_map_state(1, 2013)
```

And there we have it.
